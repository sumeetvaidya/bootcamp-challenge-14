# Bootcamp Challenge-14 Machine Learning Trading Bot

A financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world, constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. 


Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. The goal is to create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The input is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The goal is to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

## Technologies

## Results
<br/>
There are four models that are used for analysis. <br/>
* SVC Model <br/>
* LogisticRegression <br/>
* KNeighborsClassifier used with resampled data<br/>
* BalancedRandomForestClassifier used with resampled data <br/>


### SVC Model


### Logistic Regression Model
