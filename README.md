# Bootcamp Challenge-14 Machine Learning Trading Bot

A financial advisor at one of the top five financial advisory firms in the world, constantly competes with the other major firms to manage and automatically trade assets in a highly dynamic environment. 


Alphabet Soupâ€™s business team receives many funding applications from startups every day. The goal is to create a model that predicts whether applicants will be successful if funded by Alphabet Soup.

The input is a CSV containing more than 34,000 organizations that have received funding from Alphabet Soup over the years. The goal is to create a binary classifier model that will predict whether an applicant will become a successful business. The CSV file contains a variety of information about these businesses, including whether or not they ultimately became successful.

## Technologies 
<br/>
The project is written in python and uses the sklearn and tensorflow modules.
<br/>




## Installation Guide  
<br/>
To install the program, download the git repo and run the Jupyter notebook
<br/>

<br/>

## Results
<br/>
There are four models that are used for analysis. <br/>
* SVC Model <br/>
* LogisticRegression <br/>
* KNeighborsClassifier used with resampled data<br/>
* BalancedRandomForestClassifier used with resampled data <br/>

### Summary <br/>
| Model  |  Resampling |  Train Accuracy |  Test Accuracy |  Ranking Based on Cum Returns| 
|---|---|---|---|---|
|  SVC | N  | 64%  | 55%  | 2  |
|  Logistic Regression| N  | 66%  | 52%  | 3  |
|  KNN | Y  | 80%  | 51%  | 1  |<br/>
| Balanced Random Forest| Y | 100%  | 51%  | 4 |
